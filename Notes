Limitations of Dataset:
- 1. Lack of data after 07/2022 - missing the most recent year of action: how will it affect the teams?
-- Injuries? Most prominent injuries - Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Becky Sauerbrunn, Mallory Swanson(nee Pugh)
- 2. Weird teams - https://olympics.com/en/news/india-afc-womens-asian-cup-football-history (India S and India N @ AFC Champs)
- 3. No FIFA Rankings - I guess that's not a bad thing(?)
- 4. There are 8 debutant nations
- 5. The competition context of a result is a tricky customer
