Limitations of Dataset:
- 1. Lack of data after 07/2022 - missing the most recent year of action: how will it affect the teams?
-- Injuries? Most prominent injuries - Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Becky Sauerbrunn, Mallory Swanson(nee Pugh)


Intuitions/Public thoughts:
Dark Horses - Australia - home advantage?
