# 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup - A Prediction Model
Simulating the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup which has the backdrop of being injury/missing player central, and taking place in peak summer down under. What could go wrong, eh?

Inspired by previous work on the 2022 Men's edition that was iteself part of the coursework for ISyE 521: ML in Action for Industrial Engineers, an applied ML-based epic of a course, and the brainchild of [Justin J. Boutilier, Ph.D. ](https://a4hd.github.io/)
Thank you Prof.J for showcasing the importance of the story that the data tells us, and the power and responsibility we hold because of it.

The 2022 Men's WC brought light to the island nation of Qatar (and how a tiny island nation that has never even qualified for a world cup finals hosted it). In the process of this work, we hope to unravel the ways the Women's WC differs from the Men's, how the gameplay itself is maybe different, and most especially, the teams(such as the all-powerful USWNT).
